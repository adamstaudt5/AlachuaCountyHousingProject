# AlachuaCountyHousingProject

AlachuaHousing is a program that aids in the consideration of purchasing residential properties in Alachua County. It does so by presenting the market value of properties across the county, amongst other attributes. This information will help the user determine if any of Alachua County's areas fit their budget and needs. It features a map with search functionality to find different properties in a given city or zip code. Additionally, an option is available to see non-residential properties, wherein the user may consider conversions of these for their purpose.

Note: AlchuaHousing presents properties that may or may not have been for sale in 2022. The data provided is based on properties whose market value was calculated in an official property appraisal. More information at Florida's Department of Revenue Assesment Roll found here.
